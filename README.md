##Mac OS X Theme for Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10 

This is a shell script meant for installing a Mac OS X Yosemite GTK theme along with Icons, logos and other small knacks to give the complete Mac OSX experience to your Ubuntu Machine.

This Script works on Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10 (probably other versions but not tested).

This works only on Ubuntu with Unity (that is the Vanilla Ubuntu) and not on Kubuntu, Lubuntu etc

##Usage

Open the Terminal, and run the following command. Everything will be done automatically.

```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geekpradd/Ubuntu-Mac-Theme/master/main.sh | bash
```
